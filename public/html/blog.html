    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIMITA says “If you go on a sudden  diet, you could end up binge eating. It is best to do your reserach and find out what you can and shouldn’t eat. Another mistake people do is that they eat healthy food through the day but binge and eat a very heavy dinner. This is not good for you. You should always keep dinner as light as possible,”.

She lists sprouts, made from any pulses (mung, horse gram, cowpea), yoghurt (a good source of B12 and calcium, and a natural probiotic), green leafy vegetables (drumstick leaves, amaranth, methi), and pomegranate and guava (rich in vitamin C) as must-haves in your diet.
